REQUIRED LIBRARIES: 
	numpy
	pandas
	matplotlib
	scipy
	sys
	xml
	sklearn
	osmnx
	networkx
	folium

TO RUN: 
	A graph and dataframe must be created before routes may be generated (these are already provided but may be generated with create_graph.py and create_dataframe.py)
		python3 create_graph.py
		python3 create_dataframe.py amenities-vancouver.json.gz
	routes may be generated with route.py
		python3 route.py landmarks_data.csv graph.osm origin_lat origin_lon destination_lat destination_lon output_folder num_stops max_distance num_routes
		arguments:
			landmarks_data.csv = 
			graph.osm = 
			origin_lat, origin_lon = the position of the user when they wish to begin a journey, specified with latitude and longitude
			destination_lat destination_lon = the users destination, specified with latitude and longitude
			output_folder = the folder in which routes will be generated
			num_stops = the number of amenities the user wishes to be taken past on their journey
			max_distance_multiplier = how far the user is willing to go out of their way, specified by a multiplier of the total distance
			num_routes = the number of routes the user wishes to generate
		example:
			python3 route.py landmarks_data.csv graph.osm 49.26348236022651 -123.20673804503969 49.26751502457303 -123.07181219914847 output 5 1.5 5

DEMO:
	I have written 2 demo files which can be run with the following commands
		python3 demo1.py
		python3 demo2.py
	These demos indicate which inputs they use, when complete the results can be verified in the output folder
